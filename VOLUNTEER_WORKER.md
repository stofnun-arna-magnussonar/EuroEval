# EuroEval volunteer GPU worker

This guide is for volunteers who want to contribute GPU time. You do not need to set
project environment variables or provide GitHub, Hugging Face, or Upstash credentials.
EuroEval maintainers should use the
[volunteer worker operations guide](VOLUNTEER_WORKER_OPERATIONS.md) instead.

A worker claims one compatible evaluation at a time, downloads the pinned model and
dataset, evaluates one language, and uploads records to private staging. It does not
publish results directly to the public leaderboard.

## Contributor quick start

You need a Linux x86_64/amd64 computer with an NVIDIA GPU, a current NVIDIA
[driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/),
[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
The current image does not support NVIDIA DGX Spark or other Linux arm64 machines.

### 1. Verify that Docker can use the GPU

Copy and run both commands:

```sh
nvidia-smi
docker run --rm --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```

Both commands should list your GPU. If the second command fails, finish configuring the
NVIDIA Container Toolkit before continuing.

### 2. Start the worker

Copy and run this block once:

```sh
docker volume create euroeval-worker-cache

docker run --rm -it \
  --pull=always \
  --name euroeval-worker \
  --gpus all \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=2g \
  --shm-size=2g \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --pids-limit=512 \
  -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility \
  -v euroeval-worker-cache:/cache \
  ghcr.io/euroeval/euroeval-worker:latest
```

On the first run, open the GitHub URL printed in the terminal, enter the short code, and
approve access. The worker then starts evaluating compatible queued work and continues
until you press Ctrl-C. If no work is available, it waits and checks again.

The named Docker volume preserves authentication, model downloads, and unfinished work
between runs. To contribute again later, run the same `docker run` command; you normally
will not need to authenticate again.

Do not add `--privileged`, host networking, the Docker socket, a home-directory mount,
or project credentials. The worker never needs your `HF_TOKEN`, GitHub token, or Upstash
credentials.

### Optional: pin the exact image version

To pin a deployment, pull the current image and print its immutable digest reference:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/euroeval/euroeval-worker:latest
docker image inspect ghcr.io/euroeval/euroeval-worker:latest \
  --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'
```

Copy the resulting `ghcr.io/euroeval/euroeval-worker@sha256:...` value and replace the
final `ghcr.io/euroeval/euroeval-worker:latest` argument in step 2 with it. Record that
value for later runs if the deployment must remain pinned.

## How volunteer evaluation works

1. The worker completes the broker-mediated GitHub device flow. The OAuth login must be
   assignable to issues in the EuroEval repository; otherwise the worker stops with
   instructions to use an eligible GitHub account.
2. It reports NVIDIA hardware and asks for a compatible queued model/language.
3. The broker anonymously verifies that the queued Hugging Face model is public,
   ungated, pinned to an immutable revision, safetensors-only, free of repository Python
   and remote-code configuration, within the reported disk/GPU limits, and exposes one
   supported EuroEval capability (`encoder` or `generative`).
4. The worker independently refetches the same immutable metadata and capability before
   evaluation, then evaluates with remote code disabled and safetensors required.
5. Each record is uploaded idempotently to private Hugging Face staging.
6. For a lease that requires contamination collection, the worker explicitly runs the
   `contamination-detection` task alongside the normal official tasks. Generative models
   reuse the already loaded model for bounded greedy completions; encoder models record
   that the task is not applicable. A lease without that requirement selects only the
   normal official datasets, despite the public default including the canary. The
   resulting canary record uses the ordinary result upload and review path, while its
   broker lease field remains control-plane metadata.
7. The broker validates the complete lease and marks it ready for review.

Issue assignees are the mutable, authoritative active evaluators and credit identities
for both manual and volunteer work. Maintainers can transfer ownership or credit by
changing assignees; that fences old volunteer leases. Multiple assignees are valid when
multiple volunteers contribute different languages, and accepted assignees are retained.
An assignee is removed only after rejection or intentional release. Signed marker
contributors are audit and integrity evidence only, not authoritative identity.

A worker can be interrupted safely. The local state and exact result bytes remain in the
named volume. Restarting before lease expiry resumes the same lease; after expiry, the
broker may lease the language again and the old local state is archived. An interrupt
does not immediately release an active lease. Submitted records can be retried without
changing their digest. A `No volunteer evaluation work` message is normal when the queue
is empty. `No NVIDIA GPU` means that the host runtime did not expose a usable GPU.

## Data and credential handling

The `/cache` volume is private worker state. When a lease requires canary collection it
may temporarily contain the private `{row_id, text}` corpus and plaintext-free evidence.
It never contains the scoring key, expected targets, matched controls, Hugging Face
organisation token, or private scoring records. Back it up only if the backup is
protected as a secret, and remove it when decommissioning a worker. To discard a
worker's local credential and cached data:

```sh
docker volume rm euroeval-worker-cache
```

Revoking or replacing the broker credential is an operator action; deleting the volume
does not revoke a credential already issued by the broker. Contact the EuroEval
maintainer before decommissioning a registered contributor worker.
