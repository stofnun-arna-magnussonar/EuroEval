"""Off-repo backup rotation for the results directory.

`RESULTS_DIR` holds a tree of JSON records (results/<model>/<record>.json)
and is the source of truth for the leaderboard pipeline. We don't track it
in git (tens of MB and growing), so this module snapshots each successful
run to BACKUPS_DIR as a single compressed archive with a timestamp suffix,
copies that archive to the Jottacloud Archive under BACKUPS_ARCHIVE_DIR, and
deletes the local snapshots whose off-machine copy is confirmed -- so the
local directory holds one snapshot rather than growing without bound.
`BACKUPS_MAX_BYTES` still caps the local copies when no Archive is reachable.

If `RESULTS_DIR` is missing or empty at startup,
`restore_from_backup_if_missing` extracts the most recent backup into place so
the pipeline can run.
