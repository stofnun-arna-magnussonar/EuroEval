    Syncs the EuroEval/results bucket into RESULTS_DIR, then reads every
    per-record JSON file from the tree structure
    (``results/<model>/<dataset>__<split>__<shot>.json``). Records staged in
    NEW_RESULTS_PATH (a transient JSONL file) are folded in (and the staging
    file removed) so manually added results are picked up exactly once. No
    distinction is made between raw and processed results; leaderboard consumers
    receive the EEE records exactly as stored.

    Deduplicates ordinary records by canonical storage identity using
    :func:`.result_identity.dedup_newer_record`. Auxiliary canary records remain
    distinct until private scoring has rejected immutable conflicts or selected the
    newest mutable snapshot.

    Only the EEE envelope structure is validated here. The "precious" metadata
    fields (commercially_licensed, open, trained_from_scratch) are intentionally
    not required at load time: results posted from compute VMs can't supply them,
    so they're filled in later by the interactive ``add_missing_entries`` step
    and enforced when the processed records are written back out.

    Returns:
        All evaluation results in EEE format. Ordinary records are deduplicated by
        storage identity; auxiliary records retain candidate snapshots for scoring.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
