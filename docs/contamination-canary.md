# Private contamination canary

EuroEval includes a prospective, non-scoring contamination canary. It tests for exposure
to one specific EuroEval release artefact; it does **not** prove that a model saw an
upstream benchmark dataset, identify its training source, or measure benchmark score
inflation.

## Protocol

The frozen private dataset is `EuroEval/watermark-audit` at revision
`16d468bbacc284c912a8598a392239af2387ca53`. Its 256 rows form 32 independent keyed
groups of eight. Evaluators receive only `{row_id, text}`. The scoring key, exposed
targets, matched controls, and private records remain maintainer-side.

The public evidence schema is `contamination-canary-evidence/v1`. Evidence contains
model and revision provenance, protocol and corpus revisions, row IDs, prompt SHA-256
digests, collection status, and at most two normalised completion words per row. It
never contains full prompts, corpus text, targets, controls, keys, credentials, provider
response objects, or raw exceptions.

## Collection and storage

Contamination detection is an ordinary task and can be selected directly:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id> --task contamination-detection
```

It is automatically included in suite, ordinary task, and language runs whenever no
`--dataset` is selected. A targeted `--dataset` evaluation deliberately omits the
canary, so use the explicit task invocation above when canary evidence is wanted for a
targeted run. There is no bespoke canary flag, and no separate Hugging Face login is
required. The task uses the normal Hugging Face download cache and EuroEval's packaged,
obfuscated dataset credential.
`--download-only` caches the corpus alongside other requested artefacts. Offline
evaluation uses the cached revision; if it is missing or invalid, the task records
`failed/corpus_unavailable`.

Local decoders reuse the loaded vLLM model; hosted decoders use isolated requests
through the existing LiteLLM wrapper. Encoders emit `not_applicable/encoder` without a
generation call. Generation is greedy and bounded to six tokens, then reduced to the
first two Unicode-NFC words.

The `contamination-canary[-<language>]` result is appended to the ordinary
`euroeval_benchmark_results.jsonl`. EuroEval does not upload local results implicitly.
If a user keeps that file local, the evidence remains local. If the user submits normal
results, the canary record follows the same result endpoint and private staging path as
every other EEE record. Completion-bearing records are scored before approval and are
not promoted to the public `EuroEval/results` bucket. They remain in ordinary private
staging (or the user's local result files) as the audit source. There is no evidence
sidecar, outbox, receipt, or dedicated evidence bucket.

Volunteer workers receive the corpus only when the broker's authenticated lease requires
canary collection. They do not receive the broker's organisation token, and the
resulting EEE record is uploaded through the ordinary result endpoint and staging
bucket.

## Private leaderboard scoring

Only `src/leaderboards/` interprets submitted evidence. Evaluation code never receives
the private key or computes the decision. Leaderboard processing:

1. separates auxiliary canary records from ranking records;
2. validates their frozen corpus bindings and private-record provenance;
3. scores exposed and matched-control exact completions over 32 independent groups;
4. marks exposure when the exposed exact rate and exposed-minus-control difference are
   both at least 0.10 and the paired two-sided group sign-test p-value is at most 0.01;
5. warns the maintainer and asks whether to remove the whole canonical model from
   generated leaderboards using `[Y/n]` (default yes).

A non-interactive run defaults to removal when the detector is positive. Confirmed
removals are kept in owner-only audit state under `EUROEVAL_CANARY_PRIVATE_DIR`, so
repeated generation—including `--skip-results-processing`—continues to exclude the model
without publishing the evidence. Corrupt or unwritable durable exclusion state blocks
generation rather than silently re-ranking a removed model. Collected volunteer evidence
must also be scoreable before approval; a typed non-collected result still allows
unrelated ordinary results to proceed. Source records remain in private staging or local
storage for audit. Auxiliary records never become public metrics or rankings, and all
datasets/revisions/variants of a selected model are filtered from generated
leaderboards.

Configure private scoring with owner-only paths:

```sh
umask 077
export EUROEVAL_CANARY_KEY="$HOME/.config/euroeval/watermark-audit-v1.key"
export EUROEVAL_CANARY_PRIVATE_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/euroeval/private-canary-v5"
# Optional private report:
export EUROEVAL_CANARY_REPORT_PATH="$HOME/.local/state/euroeval/canary/report.json"
```

`EUROEVAL_CANARY_PRIVATE_DIR` must contain `canary-manifest.json` and
`canary-records.jsonl`. The directory must be mode `0700`; the key and private files
must be mode `0600`. Missing private configuration, unavailable corpus data, malformed
evidence, and scoring errors do not abort unrelated result processing. Historical
score-only records cannot be checked retroactively.

For a report-only audit of all canary results in a benchmark JSONL file, use the
persistent script instead of setting those environment variables:

```sh
uv run src/scripts/canary/score_contamination_canaries.py RESULTS_FILE \
  --key ~/.config/euroeval/watermark-audit-v1.key \
  --private-dir ~/.local/share/euroeval/private-canary-v5 \
  --report-path ~/.local/state/euroeval/canary/report.json
```

`RESULTS_FILE` is optional and defaults to `euroeval_benchmark_results.jsonl`; the
private paths shown are the option defaults. The script writes the complete scoring
report to standard output without evidence completions. It does not prompt, approve or
reject a submission, or update durable exclusions.

## Local protocol research

Research-only generation, exposure, and analysis tools live under `src/scripts/canary/`;
see its README. These scripts may use private targets and local study artefacts. They
are separate from production collection and leaderboard scoring.

The earlier green-list detector is retained only as a negative result: its five-arm
study produced about a 0.088 percentage-point lift and was rejected. Grouped keyed
completion pilots showed strong exact exposed/control separation, but the frozen pilot
reports remain failures under their predeclared stricter gates. The production policy
above is therefore versioned and should be changed only through a new protocol or policy
revision, never by post-hoc threshold adjustment.
